# LoRa-2.4GHz-Ranging-and-Localization

- **Firmware folder**: it contains the .bin file to update the firmware of the SX1280 dev kit. It is the latest version for the moment ([firmware from Semtech](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-connect/sx1280)). Be sure to check the website first for the latest version. (To update the firmware simply drag and drop the .bin file to the kit, as it will appear as an external mass storage)

- **Guides folder**: In this folder you can find user guides (from Semtech) that could be helpful for experimentation (ranging, localization, etc.) or understanding LoRa 2.4GHz in general.

- For the IDE we will use STM32CudeIDE (download from [here](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html?dl=I4k812GOXSWbAAyIj%2BGFtA%3D%3D%2CSgMwDKokNsmRdtX78C34woS93Gjzkjk7Lp3SimOhMvN%2FNysaiq5DmM6N9OMdaSVUmE9lDxv4s4rx3AwQE1YElEZj1rQljdfV%2BS5pbEK9JtItqnALmNkyNgdlmrZDWjpink3CTk9IK4mSZdiRpB2bGQRb5I%2BiiCIqE3UzS5EgGlGviLotSDJhtzeYkT3QZM8q50yaAPXvrFrd67lp5RkwINf2LbpZs2Zdpp0FgtifLOZAT8U7tejLoWNpMuuUCdZVuwN%2F3384rG2TbChVneWdeGTlPerslhQpqGDNldsz%2F0u%2FRb7Zcb5G4mULVYY3oiUhhcUrl1tUyLrsLhLXNU5Lw1cFWY7nQuSIFwzidFXcKRoxeByIm7SbETzoETirn66bFvc%2FE%2BegP2Hszob1YU8NHesLJ%2BlII0R28G5QdKAKB%2Balt3tkAg9iJIhg9lDvNMgBMiiQs2uqStSDTnxKa0X6iz%2F1I10imo3LxFjNGM5iVRY%3D#overview))

- After downloading the zip file, unzip it and then execute simply as fllows:
  
```bash
#first make the installer executable:
chmod +x st-stm32cubeide_1.18.0_24413_20250227_1633_amd64.deb_bundle.sh

#Run the installer:
sudo ./st-stm32cubeide_1.18.0_24413_20250227_1633_amd64.deb_bundle.sh
```
The kit used is **[SX1280DVK1ZHP](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-connect/sx1280dvk1zhp#talk-with-us-today)**, 2.5GHz SX1280 Development Kit composed of:
- Radio board: SX1280RF1ZHP RF Module
- microcontroller MBED board: STM32 Nucleo-64 Development Board (NUCLEO-L476RG with an STM32L476 MCU)
- Touchscreen Interface

Make sure that Nucleo board is recognized as a serial device and the communication link is working:
```bash
ls -l /dev/ttyACM*
#Their should be an output (like /dev/ttyACM0 for example), otherwise troubleshoot to fix it
```
The Linux system could detect the ST-LINK, but it struggles to communicate properly. This often happens due to missing permissions or driver issues, thus try maybe:
```bash
# Add your user to the dialout group (if not done already):
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
#Then Log out and back in (or reboot) for it to take effect.
#Try again to check for ttyACM and if you're lucky it should be recognized now
```


- **Code folder**: In this folder you found the basic code that is generated by the IDE. **main.c** file, has the code generated, written in C language! It is the startup code that STM32CubeIDE generates when we create a new project. It doesnâ€™t do anything meaningful yet, just initializes hardware components.
